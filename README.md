# San-Francisco-Cafe-Data-Analysis
Businesses want to understand both the physical world around them and how people interact with the physical world. 
We plan to approach this data from the perspective of a new business, potentially considering entering the coffee shop sector in San Francisco. 
We will attempt to ask and answer the type of questions that would be relevant to such a business feasibility exploration. 
Safegraph suggests that the type of questions that can be easily investigated are: 
â€œWhat times of day do people visit this place? 
How long do visitors stay at this place? 
Additionally, we may investigate things like: What is the average open hours for coffee shops in the city? 
Do these hours vary by geographic location? Which neighborhoods see the highest traffic in their coffee shops? 
Do coffee shops with no near competitors or those in busy areas see the most customer traffic?

This was a group project done by Darshit Doshi and Jared Kohler.

Don't try to run the jupyter notebook as many imports and data files will be missing in your laptop.
